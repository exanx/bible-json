She did not seek feminine ornaments, except that whatever Hegai the eunuch and keeper of the virgins chose, he gave her to adorn her. For she was very attractive, and her incredible beauty made her appear gracious and amiable in the eyes of all",

And it turned out to be the twelfth month, which is called Adar",

And the letters were sealed with his ring",

How then can I go in to the king, when, for thirty days now, I have not been called to him?",
