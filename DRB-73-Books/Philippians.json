  "27": "For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him: and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.",
  "28": "Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.",
  "29": "Receive him, therefore, with all joy in the Lord: and treat with honour such as he is.",
