  "1": "Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer,",
  "2": "And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow-soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.",
  "3": "Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "4": "I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers,",
  "5": "Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:",
  "6": "That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, which is in you in Christ Jesus.",
  "7": "For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity: because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.",
  "8": "Wherefore, having much confidence in Christ Jesus to command thee that which is to the purpose:",
  "9": "For charity sake I rather beseech, thou being such a one, as Paul an old man, and now also a prisoner also of Jesus Christ:",
  "10": "I beseech thee for my son, Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my chains,",
  "11": "Who heretofore was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee.",

  "13": "Whom I would have retained with me, that for thee he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:",
  "14": "But without thy counsel I would do nothing, that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.",
  "15": "For perhaps he, therefore, departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him for ever:",
  "16": "Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?",
  "17": "If, therefore, thou count me a partner, receive him as myself:",
  "18": "And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt: put that to my account.",
  "19": "I, Paul, have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.",
  "20": "Yea, brother; may I enjoy thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.",
  "21": "Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.",
  "22": "But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.",
  "23": "Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, salutes thee,",
  "24": "Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow-labourers.",
  "25": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
